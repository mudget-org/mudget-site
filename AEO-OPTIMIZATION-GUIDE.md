| Income Limit | $153,000 (2025) | No limit |
| Annual Contribution | $7,000 | $7,000 |
| Tax Treatment | Direct contribution | Convert after contribution |
| Complexity | Simple | Moderate |
```

#### 5. FAQ Section in Every Post
```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is the backdoor Roth IRA legal?
Yes, the backdoor Roth IRA is completely legal. It exists because Congress created income limits for direct Roth contributions but not for Roth conversions.

### What is the pro-rata rule?
The pro-rata rule treats all your traditional IRA money as one pool for tax purposes during conversions. This can complicate backdoor Roth strategies if you have existing traditional IRA balances.

### How much can I contribute through backdoor Roth?
You can contribute $7,000 annually through backdoor Roth IRA (plus $1,000 catch-up if 50+).
